# To-Do List

This is my simple To-Do List App created in JavaScript.
It is a single page app.

## Installation

Download code files and use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) install to download all the needed node modules.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To view the Web Application on your own web browser use command in the console:

```bash
npm start
```

This will create a link in your console to open the local host file.

Currently the application only displays the data from the to-do.json file and has to functionality to add or edit tasks, however this is a "psuedo" delete feature that will delete the tasks in the Store. They will return when the page is reloaded.
